          <p>
			I am a very highly work motivated person.  I have been in the tech field my whole life mainly as a network engineer and recently decided to finally change my career to a Web Developer which is what I have always wanted to do. I live with my Fiance and dog and enjoy my life with them.  My hobby's include coding and crossfit 5-6 days a week.

			I take a lot of pride in my work when it comes to coding and crossfit and try to do it the best that I can.
